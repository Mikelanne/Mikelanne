I'm currently packing up my life and moving from Florida to New York State! 🌴 -> 🌇  <br/>
I'm also currently working full time as a customer service representative! :phone: <br/>
I'm very excited for all the changes happening in my life and I'm ready for my first job as a Web Developer!<br/><br/>

In the meantime, I'm working on an updated version of my Wheel of Time Companion <br>
This version will have a React/Redux front end with: <br/>
[] User functionality! <br/>
[] This will be TOTALLY spoiler free! The user will input all their information and won't be able to see info from anyone else <br/>
[] Show pages for each Character, Group, and Location! <br/>
[] MAPS! From the books! <br/>
[] The ability to edit and add characters, groups, and locations <br/>
[] Client-Side Routes! <br/>
[] A NavBar with search capibilites! <br/>
[] A Ruby on Rails API backend <br/>
