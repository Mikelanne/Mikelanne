### Currently...

I'm currently packing up my life and moving from Florida to New York State! üå¥ -> üåá  <br/>
I'm also currently working full time as a customer service representative! :phone: <br/>
I'm very excited for all the changes happening in my life and I'm ready for my first job as a Web Developer!<br/>

In the meantime, I'm working on an updated version of my Wheel of Time Companion! This version will have a React/Redux frontend with: <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: User functionality! <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: This will be TOTALLY spoiler free! The user will input all their information and won't be able to see info from anyone else <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: Show pages for each character, group, and location! <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: MAPS! From the books! <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: The ability to edit and add characters, groups, and locations <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: Client-Side Routes! <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: A NavBar with search capibilites! <br/>
:ballot_box_with_check: A Ruby on Rails API backend <br/>

The Wheel of Time Companion is a passion project for me. I love the series but I encountered a MAJOR spoiler when I was only on Book 1 out of 14 because I Googled a character to get more information. I can't wait to finish and host this app.

As a long time restaurant employee, I also plan on making a Point of Sale system on my own as well. One thing I've always talked about was how we can improve those systems in restaurants to benefit everyone.
